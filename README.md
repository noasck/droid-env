# about


this is a bit crazy but using termux you can run full featured development environment ON ANDROID DEVICE


**purpose:**

1. run self-contained dev env
2. develop on isolated env, use same hw for testing
3. just 4 fun

--------------------------------------------

**my t0d0 list**
- [ ] establish reliable work env
- [ ] compile APK
- [ ] add OpenGLES
- [ ] render some fonts, or add dearimgui or nuklear
- [ ] render 3D, make some demo
- [ ] perhaps automate APK installation
